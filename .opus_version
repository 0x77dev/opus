    environments, error messages, and stack traces, oh my!
    Changed the way processes are launched.
    multishell.openTab and kernel.run now accept the current environment as a parameter.
    That new process inherits a copy of the passed environment.
    Reduces complexity as the calling process is not required to create a suitable env.
    Stack traces have been greatly improved and now include the stack for coroutines that error.
